 # STM32F3-SiRadio - Open Source Si446x Radio module #

#### NOTICE: BUILDABLE, currently in TESTING

Still a work in process, but functional.  Takes the Tracduino code and ports it to the
STM32F303.  Based upon an STMF3mini board that I did which matches the Arduino pro-mini
feature, pin, function on the same layout as the pro-mini

This is the firmware for the SiRadio board
